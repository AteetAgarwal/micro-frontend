Here's a sample `README.md` file to guide users on how to execute the three apps using `npm run webpack`:

# Micro-Frontend Apps: Insurance System  

This repository contains three micro-frontend applications:  
1. **Insurance Details** (`insurance-details`)  
2. **Premium Calculator** (`premium-calculator`)  
3. **Insurance Container** (`insurance-container`)  

These apps leverage **Webpack Module Federation** to demonstrate dynamic module sharing and micro-frontend integration.

---

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)  
- **npm** (v6 or later)  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AteetAgarwal/micro-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the parent folder:  
   ```bash
   cd parent-folder
   ```

3. Install dependencies for each app:  
   ```bash
   cd insurance-details
   npm install
   cd ../premium-calculator
   npm install
   cd ../insurance-container
   npm install
   ```

---

## **Running the Applications**

To execute the apps using Webpack, follow these steps:

### **1. Insurance Details App**
1. Navigate to the app directory:  
   ```bash
   cd insurance-details
   ```

2. Run the Webpack:  
   ```bash
   npm run webpack
   ```

### **2. Premium Calculator App**
1. Navigate to the app directory:  
   ```bash
   cd premium-calculator
   ```

2. Run the Webpack build:  
   ```bash
   npm run webpack
   ```

### **3. Insurance Container App**
1. Navigate to the app directory:  
   ```bash
   cd insurance-container
   ```

2. Run the Webpack build:  
   ```bash
   npm run webpack
   ```

## **Integration via Module Federation**

Each app can be run independently but is designed to demonstrate **dynamic module federation** for sharing components and logic across micro-frontends.  

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.  
- If ports conflict, modify the port in the respective `webpack.config.js` file.  
- For issues with Webpack builds, check the Webpack logs for detailed error messages.
